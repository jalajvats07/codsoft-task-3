          <h2>Face Detection Using Java </h2>
          <p>I recently completed a face detection project that aimed <br>to develop a robust system capable of accurately identifying and locating human faces in images and videos.<br> Utilizing OpenCV and deep learning techniques,<br> I implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect facial features with high precision. <br>The project involved preprocessing images, training the model on a diverse dataset, and optimizing it for real-time performance.<br> Through this project, I gained valuable experience in computer vision, machine learning, and the practical application of neural networks. <br>The successful deployment of the face detection system highlighted the potential of AI in enhancing security, user authentication, and personalized user experiences.</p>

          <h2>Tic-Toe using Python</h2>
          <p>I recently developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python, focusing on creating an engaging and interactive experience for users. The project involved designing a user-friendly interface with a grid-based layout, where players could take turns marking their moves. I implemented the game logic to check for winning combinations and handle edge cases such as draws. To enhance the user experience, I included features such as highlighting the winning line and providing options for resetting the game. This project helped me improve my skills in Python programming, game development, and user interface design. It also underscored the importance of writing clean, maintainable code and considering the userâ€™s perspective in software development.</p>

          <h2>Website Using HTML/CSS</h2>
          <p>I recently completed a website development project where I created a dynamic and responsive website for a local business using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project involved designing a modern and visually appealing layout that was both user-friendly and mobile-compatible. I integrated various features such as a contact form, image gallery, and interactive map to enhance user engagement. Additionally, I utilized JavaScript to implement dynamic content loading and improve the website's interactivity. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in front-end web development, responsive design, and user experience optimization. The successful deployment of the website not only improved the business's online presence but also provided me with a deeper understanding of web development best practices and the importance of delivering a seamless user experience.</p>
